            The purpose of this notice is to provide information and
            clarification regarding the use of the term “guaranteed” in relation
            to financial products and services. As a provider of financial
            strategies, Legacy Life Agency wants to ensure that potential
            clients and investors understand the nature of guarantees and that
            they are not provided by Legacy Life Agency Solutions but rather by
            the issuer of the financial product or service. It is also important
            for potential clients and investors to understand that financial
            advice and investment decisions should be tailored to their unique
            financial situations and goals and that seeking advice from multiple
            sources is encouraged. By providing this notice, Legacy Life Agency
            hopes to promote transparency, clarity, and informed decision-making

            We encourage potential clients to seek advice from multiple sources,
            including other financial professionals, and to carefully consider
            their options before making any financial decisions. It is important
            for potential clients and investors to understand that any
            guarantees made in relation to financial products or services are
            provided by the issuer of the product or service and not by Legacy
            Life Agency. Our role is to provide guidance and education based on
            our clients’ unique financial situations and goals. We work to
            ensure our clients have a thorough understanding of the risks and
            potential benefits associated with any financial product or service,
            but we do not have the authority to provide guarantees or assurances
            regarding future performance or results. Any guarantees associated
            with a financial product or service are the responsibility of the
            issuer of the product or service and not Legacy Life Agency. By

            products and services, we aim to promote transparency and clarity in

            associated with any financial product or service before making any
            investment decisions. At Legacy Life Agency, we understand that each
            client has unique financial situations and goals. We recognize that
            there is no one-size-fits-all solution when it comes to financial
            planning and investment strategies. Our services are designed to
            provide personalized solutions that are tailored to each client’s
            specific situation. We work with our clients to understand their
            financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment time horizon. We
            also take into account other factors, such as potential tax
            implications, estate planning, and retirement goals, when making
            recommendations. By restating the fact that each client has unique
            financial situations and goals, we emphasize the importance of
            customized financial strategies and the need for personalized
            education and tools. We strive to provide our clients with tailored
            solutions that are designed to help them achieve their specific
            financial goals and objectives. At Legacy Life Agency, we recognize
            that what may be good for one client may not be suitable for
            another. Each client has unique financial goals, risk tolerance,
            investment time horizon, and other factors that influence the type
            of financial products and services that would be best suited for
            them. We work with our clients to identify their individual needs
            and goals and to provide customized solutions that are tailored to
            their specific situations. This approach ensures that each client
            receives personalized strategies and tools appropriate to their
            unique financial situation. By emphasizing that what may be good for
            one client may not be suitable for another, we aim to promote
            transparency and clarity throughout our client relationships. We
            encourage potential clients to invite their other financial
            professionals to carefully consider their financial situation and
            goals before making any investment decisions. At Legacy Life Agency,
            we encourage potential clients to seek advice from other
            professionals as part of their financial planning process. While we
            strive to provide our clients with comprehensive and tailored
            advice, we recognize that seeking multiple perspectives can be
            beneficial. In particular, we encourage our clients to seek advice
            from other financial professionals, such as tax advisors, estate
            planners, and attorneys. These professionals can provide valuable
            insights and expertise that can help inform financial decisions. By
            encouraging potential clients to seek advice from other
            professionals, we promote a collaborative and informed approach to
            financial planning. We believe that this approach can help our
            clients make the best decisions for their unique financial
            situations and goals. Seeking advice from multiple sources can
            provide several benefits for potential clients. Firstly, it can help
            ensure that clients receive a well-rounded and comprehensive
            perspective on their financial situation. Financial advisors, tax
            professionals, estate planners, and attorneys each bring a unique
            perspective and set of skills to the table, and seeking advice from
            multiple sources can help ensure that all aspects of a client’s
            financial situation are considered. Secondly, seeking advice from
            multiple sources can help clients identify any potential conflicts
            of interest or biases in the advice they receive. By hearing advice
            from different professionals, clients can compare and contrast
            different perspectives and make more informed decisions. Finally,
            seeking advice from multiple sources can help clients identify areas
            where they may be over or under-invested. Different professionals
            may have different ideas about appropriate asset allocation and
            investment strategies, and seeking advice from multiple sources can
            help ensure that clients are investing in a way that aligns with
            their specific financial goals and objectives. Overall, seeking
            advice from multiple sources can be an important part of the
            financial planning process. By promoting a collaborative and
            informed approach to financial planning, we believe that our clients
            can make the best decisions for their unique financial situations
            and goals.
